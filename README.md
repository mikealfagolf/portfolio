# Public portfolio
This repository is intended to serve as a public portfolio of my work as a software developer. Each directory contains code from a separate project that I worked on during my career but is no longer actively being used in a production environment.

All passwords, encryption keys, copyrighted code, personal/company data and any other sensitive information have all been changed or removed entirely; so some projects may not run or even compile as-is.

Project descriptions, technologies used, problems solved, my role in them and other relevant information can be personally discussed by requesting a meeting or interview.
